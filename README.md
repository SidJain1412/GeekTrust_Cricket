Simulating a cricket match where 40 runs are needed to win in 4 overs

## Problem statement:

It's the last 4 overs of the match. Lengaburu needs 40 runs to win with 3 wickets left. Can star batsman Kirat win it for the team?

In this problem you have to simulate the last 4 overs (using weighted random number generation based on probability), generate ball by ball commentary, and determine the final result. Each player has a different probability for scoring runs.
